# Pokemon-REST-API

The foundation for a REST APIi which queries for a certain Pokémo form, all the forms a Pokémon species may have, all Pokémon stored in a MySQL database run on the local machine, and any Pokémon who may have a type advantage against a Pokémon. A more sophisticated Node.JS version of this API is available in my Pokemon-Rest-API-Node GitHub project.
